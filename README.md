# recurse_compress
This is a basic script I made during a fileserver cleanup and prepping various directories/subdirectories for archival.

A directory is provided to the script, it gets a list of all subdirectories, and for each subdirectory, it compresses each subdirectory under that in to 7zip archives.

# Usage
`./recurse_compress.py directory/name/`
